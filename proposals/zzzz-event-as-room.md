# MSC ZZZZ : Event as room (TODO)

TODO: find a better name :D

This type is only an idea yet and should be defined more clearly.

Maybe the topic of another MSC.

```
m.social.event
```

This room type could be reserved for the event use case. i.e. for a
single event, invite people and let each user say if he will be present.

Idea:

What should be defined for the event
* name : [regular event] : room name 
* main picture : [regular event] : room avatar
* topic : [regular event] : room topic
* event location
* event time start
* event time end
* add a way to say if we will come (maybe use regular polls) 

Regular events : the actual event is already defined in matrix,
no need to reimplement.
