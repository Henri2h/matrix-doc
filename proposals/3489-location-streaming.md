# MSC3489 - m.beacon: Sharing streams of location data

## Problem

A common communication feature is sharing live location data with other users.
Use cases include helping users find each other and asset tracking. Matrix
doesn't currently provide a way of doing this.

Therefore, we'd like to provide a way for users to efficiently advertise the
time-limited real-time location of themselves or arbitrary assets to other
users in a room.

## Proposal

This MSC adds the ability to publish real-time location beacons to Matrix by
building on MSC3488 (m.location: Extending events with location data).

We introduce two types of events to describe beacons: the first, a state event, contains
the metadata about the beacons advertised by a given user: `m.beacon_info.*`.
As Matrix doesn't yet have a way to stop other users overwriting an event
other than setting its state_key to be the owner's mxid, we work around this
by letting the final part of the event type be a unique ID for the beacon.
(Ideally we would put the unique ID as its `state_key` and flip a bit on the
event to indicate that it can only ever be written by its owner - we may get
this via MSC3414 encrypted state events).

This lets us track an arbitrary number of beacons per user, and avoids beacon
metadata being duplicated as location data is shared.

An example `m.beacon_info.*` event is:

```json5
{
    "type": "m.beacon_info.@matthew:matrix.org",
    "state_key": "@matthew:matrix.org",
    "content": {
        "m.beacon_info": {
            "description": "The Matthew Tracker", // same as an `m.location` description
            "timeout": 86400000, // how long from the last event until we consider the beacon inactive in milliseconds
        },
        "m.ts": 1436829458432, // creation timestamp of the beacon on the client
        "m.asset": {
            "type": "m.self" // the type of asset being tracked as per MSC3488
        }
    }
}
```

Separately, we have the actual location data from the beacon in question
as `m.beacon` events forming a reference relationship to the original `m.beacon_info` event.

Storing the location data as references as opposed to in a state event has multiple advantages:
* Location data is easily encrypted (no dependency on MSC3414)
* Doesn't thrash state resolution by storing new location points every time they change
* Paginated history easily accessible through the `relations` endpoint. If history is not wanted, then one can use
data retention policies(e.g. exploding messages) to ensure it does not
accumulate unnecessarily.
* Allows other users to request data from a beacon


`m.beacon` events should be sent at a variable rate which is meaningful for
the use case for the asset being tracked. This rate should not be more
frequent than sending an event every 2 seconds. If the asset is not moving,
the location should still be refreshed on a regular basis to convey that
information - e.g. every 30 seconds.

An example `m.beacon` event is:

```json5
{
    "type": "m.beacon",
    "sender": "@matthew:matrix.org",
    "content": {
        "m.relates_to": { // from MSC2674: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674
            "rel_type": "m.reference", // from MSC3267: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3267
            "event_id": "$beacon_info"
        },
        "m.location": {
            "uri": "geo:51.5008,0.1247;u=35",
            "description": "Arbitrary beacon information"
        },
        "m.ts": 1636829458432,
    }
}
```

The `m.location` section of the `m.beacon` event can include an optional
`description` field to provide user facing updates e.g. current address

## Encryption

Location data should be stored end-to-end encrypted for obvious data privacy
reasons - given the beacon data is stored as simple events that will be automatic.

## Alternatives

Initially this MSC considered storing location data in a separate state event but
that had multiple downsides:
* No encryption without MSC3414
* Difficult access to historical data, timeline pagination required
* State resolution thrasing on every location update. By storing a state event for every location datapoint, 
we put significant load on servers' state management implementations.  Current implementations
may not handle this well.

Another option would be using ephemeral data units to broadcast location updates but they
do come with downsides of their own:
* they are not persisted and cannot provide historical data
* there's no per-room API for them
* they are not end to end encrypted 

Alternatively, we could behave like MSC3401 and announce users' beacons in
`m.beacon_info.*` (similar to MSC3401's `m.call`), and then send location
data via to-device messages to interested devices.
 * Pros:
   * Doesn't thrash state resolution by storing new location points every time they change
   * Gets you easy E2EE automatically
 * Cons:
   * designs out historical geo-data use cases
   * means you are reinventing the pubsub fan-out routing you get for free with Matrix events
   * means you have to reinvent decentralised ACLs to check that the subscribing users are valid
   * means new joiners to a room won't even be able to see the most recent location for someone
   * MSC1763 data retention lets us control the historical data anyway.

Alternatively, we could send location data as normal E2EE messages. However,
clients would have to back-paginate in an unbounded fashion to confidently
say what the various beacons are doing rather than simply fishing it out of
room state.

Alternatively, we could negotiate a WebRTC data channel using MSC3401 and
stream low-latency geospatial data over the participating devices in the room.
This doesn't give us historical data, however, and requiring a WebRTC stack
is prohibitively complicated for simple clients (e.g. basic IOT devices
reporting spatial telemetry).

We could include velocity data as well as displacement data here(especially as
the W3C geolocation API provides it); this has been left for a future MSC in
the interests of avoiding scope creep.

## Security considerations

Location data is high risk for real-world abuse, especially if stored
unencrypted or persisted. The same security considerations apply as for
`m.location` data in general.

## Unstable prefix

 * `m.beacon_info.*` should be referred to as `org.matrix.msc3489.beacon_info.*` until this MSC lands.
 * `m.beacon` should be referred to as `org.matrix.msc3489.beacon` until this MSC lands.
 * `m.location` should be referred to as `org.matrix.msc3488.location.*` until MSC3488 lands.
 * `m.ts` should be referred to as `org.matrix.msc3488.ts.*` until MSC3488 lands.
 * `m.asset` should be referred to as `org.matrix.msc3488.asset.*` until MSC3488 lands.
