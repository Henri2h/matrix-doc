This room version builds on [version 7](/rooms/v7) to introduce a new
join rule that allows members to join the room based on membership in
another room.

{{% boxes/warning %}}
This room version is known to have issues relating to redactions of member
join events. [Room version 9](/rooms/v9) should be preferred over v8 when
creating rooms.

## Client considerations

Clients are encouraged to expose the option for the join rule in their
user interface for supported room versions. Specifically, this feature
is intended to be used primarily in conjunction with
[MSC1772-style Spaces](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772)
(allowing members of a space to join a given room), though any v8 capable
room will be able to support this newly introduced join rule.

The new join rule, `restricted`, is described in the Client-Server API
under the [`m.room.join_rules`](/client-server-api/#mroomjoin_rules) section.

## Server implementation components

use cases should reference.

Room version 8 adds a new join rule to allow members of a room to join another
room without invite. Otherwise, the room version inherits all properties of
[Room version 7](/rooms/v7).

### Authorization rules for events

`m.room.member` events for `membership` of `join` are now validated as such:

1. If the only previous event is an `m.room.create` and the `state_key` is the
   creator, allow.
2. If the `sender` does not match `state_key`, reject.
3. If the `sender` is banned, reject.
4. If the `join_rule` is `invite` then allow if membership state is `invite` or
   `knock`.
5. **[New in this room version]** If the `join_rule` is `restricted`:
   1. If membership state is `join`, allow.
   2. If `content.join_authorised_via_users_server` is not a user with
      sufficient permission to invite other users, reject.
   3. If the event is not validly signed by the server denoted by the user ID in
      `content.join_authorised_via_users_server`, reject.
   4. Otherwise, allow.
6. If the `join_rule` is `public`, allow.
7. Otherwise, reject.

The remaining rules are the same as in [room version 7](/rooms/v7#server-implementation-components).

### Redactions

Events of type `m.room.join_rules` now keep the following `content` properties
when the event is redacted:
* `join_rule`
* **[New in this room version]** `allow`

[Room version 9](/rooms/v9) adds additional cases of protected properties for behaviour
related to restricted rooms (the functionality introduced in v8). v9 is preferred over
v8 when creating new rooms.

The remaining rules are the same as in [room version 6](/rooms/v6#redactions) (the
last room version to modify the redaction rules).
