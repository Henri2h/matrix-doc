This room version builds on [version 8](/rooms/v8) to add additional redaction
rules that were unintentionally missed when incorporating v8.

## Client considerations

See [room version 8](/rooms/v8) for specific details regarding the addition of
restricted rooms.

Clients which implement a local redaction algorithm are encouraged to read on.

## Server implementation components

Room version 8 added a new `restricted` join rule to allow members of a room
to join another room without invite. Room version 9 is based upon v8 with the
following considerations.

### Redactions

Events of type `m.room.member` now keep the following `content` properties
when the event is redacted:
* `membership`
* **[New in this room version]** `join_authorised_via_users_server`

The remaining rules are the same as in [room version 8](/rooms/v8#redactions).

{{% boxes/rationale %}}
Without the `join_authorised_via_users_server` property redacted join events
can become invalid when verifying the auth chain of a given event, thus creating
a split-brain scenario where the user is able to speak from one server's
perspective but most others will continually reject their events.

This can theoretically be worked around with a rejoin to the room, being careful
not to use the faulty events as `prev_events`, though instead it is encouraged
to use v9 rooms over v8 rooms to outright avoid the situation.

[Issue #3373](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373) has further
information.
